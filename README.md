## Abstract  
  
A wealth of research exists to suggest that environmental attributes can facilitate or deter criminal activities, as for instance the presence of alcohol outlets or the design of defensible spaces. In this article we present an exploratory spatial analysis of the relationship between violent crime and places of worship in Recife, Brazil. This analysis aims to explore whether there is a spatial dimension to “moral communities” around places of worship. Use of a cluster detection methodology, the results suggest the presence of a strong geographical association between churches and crime. The evidence obtained for the year 2010 indicates a process of clustering of homicide events in the vicinity of places of worship. In addition, it was also possible to verify a pattern of concentration between evangelical churches and violent crimes.
